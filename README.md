# Protein-Classification

This is a final project for the Data Science Program at Lighthouse Labs. 


## Objective 
This project aims to classify protein families soley based on their sequence of aminoacid. This assumes that protein sequences can be viewed as as a language. By treating sequences as a language, we can apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) just like the English language. The neural network trained allows the input of amino acids to classify the proteins into 43 different classes. 

## Tools used: Python, Sklearn, Pandas, Jupyter, NLP, Tensorflow, Neural Network, Streamlit
