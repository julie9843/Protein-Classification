# Protein-Classification

This is a final project for the Data Science Program at Lighthouse Labs. 


## Objective 
This project aims to classify protein families soley based on their sequence of aminoacid. This assumes that protein sequences can be viewed as as a language. By treating sequences as a language, we can apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) just like the English language. The neural network trained allows the input of amino acids to classify the proteins into 43 different classes. 

## Tools used: Python, Sklearn, Pandas, Jupyter, NLP, Tensorflow, Neural Network, Streamlit

The dataset used can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shahir/protein-data-set). This dataset was retrieved from Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) Protein Data Bank (PDB). 

## Getting Started
The [Data Exploration notebook](https://github.com/julie9843/Protein-Classification/blob/main/Data%20Exploration.ipynb) consist of processing, transforming and cleaning the dataset. 
The [initial model](https://github.com/julie9843/Protein-Classification/blob/main/Machine%20Learning.ipynb) was built on classification machine learning models. However, the accuracies returned were low. I then turned to NLP processing and neural networks to build my [model](https://github.com/julie9843/Protein-Classification/blob/main/Final_NLP.ipynb). 
Then I proceeded to deploying my [app](https://github.com/julie9843/Protein-Classification/blob/main/app.py). A demo of how to navigate through the app is also shown in the [demo](https://github.com/julie9843/Protein-Classification/blob/main/Demo.mp4) file.
